How to write Talon interfaces
-----------------------------

Cross platform code in Talon is generated by the Talon.CodeGenerator project in the tools directory.

Interfaces are defined in three files:
* Base class interface -
	Usually have the name <class name>Base. These files are generated, so don't edit them directly.
	Interfaces should be defined in the appropriate json file in the definitions folder.
* Platform specific interface -
	These files usually contain the name of the platform (ie, Win32Window) and have method definitions
	generated in a separate file. The corresponding cpp file should only contain code needed to define
	the interface for the given platform or API
* Concrete interface -
	This file defines the public API for the class depending on the conditions of the build, and has the
	same name as the defined interface (ie, Window). The generated methods are included just like Platform specific
	definitions. These files can be used to define cross-platform behavior
